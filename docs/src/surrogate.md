# Surrogate
Every surrogate has a different definition depending on the parameters needed.
However, they have in common:

1. ```add_point!(::AbstractSurrogate,x_new,y_new)```
2. ```AbstractSurrogate(value)```
The first function adds a sample point to the surrogate, thus changing the internal
coefficients. The second one calculates the approximation at value.

# Creating another surrogate
It's great that you want to add another surrogate to the library!
You will need to:

1. Define a new mutable struct and a constructor function
2. Define add\_point!(your\_surrogate::AbstactSurrogate,x\_new,y\_new)
3. Define your\_surrogate(value) for the approximation

**Example**
```
mutable struct NewSurrogate{X,Y,L,U,C,A,B} <: AbstractSurrogate
  x::X
  y::Y
  lb::L
  ub::U
  coeff::C
  alpha::A
  beta::B
end

function NewSurrogate(x,y,lb,ub,parameters)
    ...
    return NewSurrogate(x,y,lb,ub,calculated\_coeff,alpha,beta)
end

function add_point!(NewSurrogate,x\_new,y\_new)

  nothing
end

function (s::NewSurrogate)(value)
  return s.coeff*value + s.alpha
end
```
